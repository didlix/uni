## Navigation

Navigation in digital environments are things like navigation bars, hyperlinks, buttons etc

More than just a way for people to get around a site.

* See context of information
* Find related information
* Find information they did not know about

More than a nav bar at the top of the page.

* An entire system that combines different elements for different needs.

_Your navigation system should cater for different users and different needs_


## Navigation, organisation and search

Relationship between navigatio, organisation and search


## Navigation, organisation and user research
* Your personas focus on who your users are and their information needs
* Your organisation scheme (and sitemap) focuses on your content
* Navigation is where you fit these pieces together to support important:
* User needs
* Business goals
* Information tasks that fulfil user needs and meet business goals

## Principles of navigation design

* Users should always be able to answer:
  * “Where am I?” (even when entering from a search engine or link to a   * bsidiary page)
  * “Where can I go (in general)?”
  * “Where can I go (from here)?”
  * “Where can I find x?” and “how can I get there?”
  * “How can I get back to where I was before or somewhere familiar?” (e.g. when lost)

* Aim for users to:
  * Feel orientated and in control
  * Find navigation easy (and, if possible, satisfying) – Not feel overwhelmed with navigation options

## Principles of navigation design: Ask yourself...

* Howisyourcontentorganised?
  * Letting users navigate content by the way it’s organised can often allow * em to find what they’re looking for
* Whatdoyouruserswanttodo?
  * You may have a well-structured navigation system, but users might prefer to nvigate another way
  * Your organisation and navigation systems may differ
  * Ensure users can do what they came to do, even if that’s not how your * ntent is organised
* What do you want your users to do?
  * Balance what user wants and what the business needs

## Navigation design: An IA’s job?

* Navigation design falls in a grey area between:
  * IA
  * Interaction Design
  * Usability Engineering
  * Information Design
  * Visual Design
* “In the real world, the boundaries are fuzzy and the lines get crossed every day.” (Morville & Rosenfeld, p. 117)

__Based on Morville & Rosenfeld (2006).__

## Navigation systems and elements
* Embedded (global, local, contextual) and supplemental (Morville & Rosenfeld, 2006)
* Structural (global, local), associative and utility (Wodtke& Govella, 2009)
* Navigation mechanisms (Kalbach, 2007)
* ‘Core’and‘extra’navigationelements(Spencer,2010)
  * Mechanisms are essentially the same as elements
* Butwedon’tcareaboutlabels,right?☺

## Embedded and supplemental navigation (Morville & Rosenfeld, 2006)
* Embeddedsystemsareintegratedwithinsite’spagesand content
  * Providing context and flexibility
  * Helping users understand where they are and where they can go next
  * Split into global (site-wide), local and contextual navigation
* Supplemental systems exist outside the site’s pagesand content

    ```
    i.e. Sitemaps.

  * Providing different ways to access the same info.
