## Interview Blurb

We are looking to understand what health services LGBTQ* people look for, how they expect to find this information and what the limitations of the current system are.

Interviews are anonymous, and will be used to design the information architecture of a website that would display this information.

We will use the acronym LGBTQ, this stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transgender and Queer.
