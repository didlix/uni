# NHS LGBTQ* Services Interview 2

## Interview Questions

## Interview Blurb

We are looking to understand what health services LGBTQ* people look for, how they expect to find this information and what the limitations of the current system are.

Interviews are anonymous, and will be used to design the information architecture of a website that would display this information.

We will use the acronym LGBTQ, this stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transgender and Queer.

### Only answer if you feel comfortable:

#### Do you identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Queer or other? / Straight?

Straight

### Questions for everyone

####  Have you ever looked for a health service online?

Yes

####  What types of health services would you like specific information about?

Was doing an online diagnosis

####  What websites would you use to try and find information about these services?

used: google to go through to the nhs.uk, wouldn't have used any others, credibility is important.

####  How would you search for this information?

Google took them straight through to the allergy, looked for images on the page that matched the allergy.
Did more searches based on the information

####  Did you find the information you were after?

Yes

####  How easy was it to find?

It's really copy heavy, so it was annoying to find

####  How did you find it?

Found via google, took you to skin allergies on the nhs website, and then based on the images they did another search.

####  How satisfied were you?

5

####  Was it easy?

No (because of the copy), but this didn't affect the level of satisfaction

####  Could it have been easier?

Yeah, more succinct in what they were talking about. Visually the layout was not useful (on nhs.uk) they try to plug a lot of information on the page.

####  Do health practices you have been to have a system that let's you leave public feedback?

No

####  Do you use any websites that allow you to do this?

No
